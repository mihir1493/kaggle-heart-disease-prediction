## Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning. 
This project looks into various python-based machine learning tools and techniques to find potential insights into the heart diseases data set. In this project I attempt to create a model that can predict weather or not someone has a heart disease based on their medical attributes. 
The dataset can be downloaded using the following urls: 
1. UCI Url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease 
2. Kaggle Url: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

The key points derived form this project is as follows:
1. Logistic Regression get us the max accuracy of 88.5% 
2. Age doesnot seem to affect the heart disease which might be due to the dataset insufficiency. 
3. The most important features which dictate the probability of one having a heart disease are the SEX, CP, EXANG, CA & THAL. 
4. The models can be further tweeked to meet out set 95% limit by increasing a fair amount of hyperparameter tuning and can be verified using cross-validation > 5.
